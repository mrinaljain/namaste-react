# React Hooks

## State Managemant

   ### useState

   ### useReducer   

   - In case there is complex state 
   - When the state logic becomes too complicated or when you need to handle state changes in a more predictable and manageable way, the useReducer hook is your best bet.
   -  useReducer takes a reducer function and initial state
      returns stateObject and dispatcher.
   ```
   const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState,init);

   ```
   *state*: represents the current value and is set to the initialState value during the initial render.
   *dispatch*: is a function that updates the state value and always triggers a re-render, just like the updater function in useState.
   *reducer*: is a function that houses all the logic of how the state gets updated. It takes state and action as arguments and returns the next state.
   *initialState*: houses the initial value and can be of any type.
   - The reducer function is always declared outside of your component and takes in a current state and action as arguments.
   
   *init*: The initializer function that should return the initial state. If itâ€™s not specified, the initial state is set to initialArg. Otherwise, the initial state is set to the result of calling init(initialArg).

   ### useSyncExternalStore

## Effect Hooks

   ### useEffect
   - ideal for syncing yourReact code with browser APIs (ex: useRef)

   ### useLayoutEffect
   - runs just before the UI paint
   - synchronous
   - example : to get height before render

   ### useInsertionEffect



   ### useRef
   - DOM elements
   - Mutable


   ### useImperetiveHandle


   ### useMemo (memoization)
   - to store the value of a heavy computation so that we dont have to call it again and again.
   - recalculates only when one of its dependency changes

   ### useCallback
   - solves the problem where callback function ka refference store ho jata hai. so it doesnt call again and again.
   - prevents function from being recreated

   ### useContext


   ### useTransition


   ### useDeferredValue

   ### useDEbugValue

   ###useID
